About

A useful program that parse, manipulate and camouflage ELF files.

**elfspirit** provides a variety of functions, including adding or deleting a section, injecting a dynamic link library for binary static, deleting the section header table to increase the difficulty of reverse engineering and parse ELF like `readelf`.

If you don't know anything about static injection, you can refer to the [ELF Static Injection to Load Malicious Dynamic Link Library](https://violentbinary.github.io/posts/1-elf-static-injection-to-load-malicious-dynamic-link-library/)

## Usage

Add a section in a ELF file

```shell
elfspirit addsec   [-n]<section name> [-z]<section size> [-o]<offset(optional)> ELF
```

Delete a section of the ELF file

```shell
elfspirit delsec   [-n]<section name> ELF
```

Statically injected dynamic link library

```shell
elfspirit injectso [-n]<section name> [-f]<so name> [-c]<configure file> [-v]<libc version> ELF
```

Delete section header table

```shell
elfspirit delshtab ELF
```

Parse ELF file

```shell
elfspirit parse ELF
```

## Building

**elfspirit** can also be installed easily:

```shell
make
```

## Dependencies

We run **elfspirit** using:

- Ubuntu 20.04 / Kali Linux 2020.4
- gcc 10.2.1
- libc-2.31/2.32

Currently, this is the only supported environment. Other environments may also work, but we unfortunately do not have the manpower to investigate compatibility issues. 

## Limitations

**elfspirit** is a work in process, and some things still aren't implemented. Following is the current list of know limitations.

-  `addsec`  The location of the added section only supports a specific offset address of ELF file, such as existing section offset, section header table offset and the end of the file. This is because if we add a section in another location, the program may not work properly.
-  `injectso` is an experimental binary, which mainly implements the idea of static injection. The current version only passes the verification test on libc-2.31/2.32. Therefore, we specially provided a JSON file to load the relevant offset addresses of other versions of libc.
